# GymDude Fitness Picks

A lightweight static site (HTML/CSS) ready for GitHub Pages.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a public repo (e.g., `gymdude`).
2. Upload all files from the `gymdude_site/` folder to the repo root.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set Source to **Deploy from a branch**, choose `main` and `/ (root)`.
4. Your site will be live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/gymdude/` (replace with your username).

## Amazon Associates tips
- After your Associates account is approved, replace product links with your **special links** that contain your tracking ID (e.g., `?tag=yourtag-21`). Short links used here are placeholders.
- Do **not** hardcode prices/screenshots; Amazon requires prices to be fetched via their official API for accuracy.
- Keep the disclosure banner visible on every page.
- Aim for at least 5–10 useful posts before applying and generate at least 1–3 sales within 180 days.
